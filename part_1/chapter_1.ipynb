    "- One of the most important advantages of using Version Control is teamwork.\n",
    "- A VCS can be local, centralized, or distributed.\n",
    "- Linux kernel developers were using BitKeeper SCM as a Version Control System. In 2005 BitKeeper SCM stopped being free. Since it was closed source, the developers lost their favorite Version Control System. The community (led by Linus Torvalds) had to find another VCS, and since an alternative was not available, they decided to create their own. Thus, Git was born."
